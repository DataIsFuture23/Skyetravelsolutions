[Live Demo Link (Add yours after deploy)]

## 🛠️ Setup Locally

1.  Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DataIsFuture23/Skyetravelsolutions.git
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the server (requires SQL Server):
    ```bash
    node server_local.js
    ```

## ☁️ Deploy via GitHub Pages (Recommended)

Since this is a static site, the easiest way to host it for free is **GitHub Pages**.

1.  Go to your repository **Settings** tab.
2.  Click **Pages** (in the left sidebar).
3.  Under **Branch**, select `main` and click **Save**.
4.  Wait 1 minute, and your site will be live!

**Note:** The "Login" and "Book Now" features require a backend database and will not function in this static deployment. The "View Details" and destination gallery will work normally via offline fallback.
